The hotel was very helpful in providing facilities for our young baby. A clean cot and baby bath was provided. The staff were helpful, polite and always service gave with a smile. The rooms were just big enough and generally facilities were very good. The showers have a slight issue with not being able to turn the on/off easily when wet, but other than that no problems with this hotel. Breakfast was good and again staff very helpful.",

Breakfast was extremely attentive and friendly under the young German manager\u2019s care (the croissants and baguette are to die for), restaurant Belga on the rooftop served exquisite mussels and an excellent steak tartare - thank you Peter and team - and the Exec lounge staff was very friendly. The superb 30th floor lounge was closed (I assume due to Covid savings needs) however the care and friendliness on display almost made up for it! Housekeeping was spot on.

Breakfast is good, but on weekends it takes too long to get a coffee. The checkin was friendly, but I didn't get any advise about the room, not sure if I got an upgrade or not. I couldn't remember what i booked, but I believe I didn't get an upgrade this time. I got my welcome drink and my points were credited the next day.

The room was great with high quality bed sheet, clean and the location was perfect, just only 5 mins walk to Terminal 21 shopping mall and BTS.  The hotel prepared a surprise BD cake to make it more memorable and the overall service was really nice.  We have got a chance to also try Belgian foods at Belga, the rooftop bars which is only 2 floors away from our room and the food was great, especially the Mussels in the pot which they cook with Hoegardenn beer and White wine, definitely will need to be back there again for dinner soon.

Think having stayed at both Mandarin and Peninsula, i can safely make my claim that that Shang is the worst out of the three.

At the very first, i suppose your hotel is famous and has good credit hotel in BKK, thus i ask for the naive help to your staff for receiving my parcels during my stay. Via FB message, i thought it was the common way to send my request. While the first parcel your staff declines to receive, after i inquire AGAIN, they finally receive my parcel. Another 2 parcels, your staff asks me about the tracking number, i am so naive that to believe your staff woild take care, that quoted dialogue from your staff,  \"Now, We have got only 1 parcel sir ,  May I have your reference parcel ID after that I will check from kerry for you.\"  I reply it is sent by flash express.  Your staff seemed to be very much busy, until i found 2 parcels were missing, your staff stated to try to fix it. Until i checked out, there are still one parcel lost.  I found that your hotel got problem on showing calling numer corrrectly (Which the wrong siuation is still ongoing), that is the reason the courier could not contact the front desk very well. And your staff, wants to rectify me that it was my main problem. Now once, even if i check out, your staff still insists that i am wrong. I am not asking your staff or your hotel to compensate my lost, but for the future if you could make it correct, might decrease the problem for sure.   As a guest, i feel insulted by telling your hotel the right thing. What if i am the technician of your hotel,it would still insult me my finding?  -  For the period without air conditioning. Your staff and related workers are trying to fix the supposed circumstances very hard, i admiire your hard work.  Also, your thoughtful idea to let guests live in other hotel, is very good measure. However, your staff changes the wording 4-5 times for the fixing time.  If we still stay the arranged hotel, in my opinion, no one would blame your hotel's management. But, when i go back to the hotel, nothing is healed, how does your hotel say? Finishing in midnight? Then turn to next day morning, then turn to befor 4 pm. What is the lesson of crisis management your hotel learn about? I am wondering to understand how it is the worst situation your hotel could kindly consider our sufferance.  Waiving for staying  one night?  That is the worst and exaggerated proposal I've ever heard. I am willing to pay your hotel for one night, and your hotel team could stay in the room without air conditioning.  How your hotel wants to pay me my suffered for one night free?  And when i ask your hotel if i could stay in the arranged hotel you send me for next 2 days, how your staff RECOMMENDS? if i knew your hotel had the issue on air conditioning during 8-9 Feb, i would not reserve your hotel. Doesn't your hotel want to make the extreme profit without caring about our feelings?  Apparently, your hotel does not care. It is lucky your hotel has guests during the pandemic. Somehow, your hotel does not treasure guests. -  No one is perfect, but not to pretend to be perfect.  Apology is not to make a room for conceiving yourself\u2026",

She was so nice answering and assisting me in the booking process and payment as well as noted all my stay purpose and expectation.  I booked a promotional rate which include early check-in, and late check-out with 1000 THB hotel credit  - This is a great deal as I planned to spend most of the time in the hotel.

As the promotion came out I booked my third stay and it remained the same. On my second stay, I even got a room on higher floor than my third stay. They put us in a room with three beds just for 2 persons. We were moved to another room and my friend can smell the painting. Are you serious??? Nothing wowed me.

She knows and remembers what I like to drink, to eat, she always provide me the packages that she think will suit with me. I really appreciate what she has done for me.

                "review_text": "I have been checking in at many Accor, SPG, and Hilton 3-4-5 star-rated  hotels for over 20 years.  I am writing this review on my second check in of this great hotel.   When comparing Mercure among its competition within the SAME CATEGORY, the Mercure Bangkok Siam reigns supreme.   Note: I find that some reviewers does a disservice to a hotel by unfairly judging a 4 star hotel with the standards of a 5 star premium hotel. This is like comparing a Honda Civic with a Mercedes. Let\u2019s be real here folks.   5/5 for Location. Hotel is located right by a major BTS National Stadium which is one station away from Paragon Siam and CentralWorld, and is a short walk from MBK Mall with its plethora of shops and good eateries.   5/5 for gym and pool facilities. I am an avid swimmer and I can vouch the pool - albeit not the largest in Bangkok - is always kept clean and it\u2019s a very decent size for swimmers doing laps. I don\u2019t have a clue as to what some reviewers are saying about the pool being too small for swimming. This pool can easily accommodate 3-5 lap swimmers at the same time. I am at the hotel gym daily and have managed to work up a great sweat on the good cardio machines and the nice range of free weights each and every time. The gym is even equipped with a nice air purifier. What more can you possibly ask for in a gym and a pool from a hotel of its category!  5/5 for Suite room. The suite room - always clean and bright - which I am staying in has a separate living room area from the bedroom ensuite. Large windows in both areas showcase spectacular city views. The fridge is replenished every day with complimentary drinks.   4.5/5 for breakfast and lounge. Yes the pandemic has shrunk the number of visitors to Bangkok substantially and all hotels are doing their best to cut cost without compromising service. Mercure Siam has had to close its Lounge so I can\u2019t really grade the lounge service while breakfast is mostly served a la carte with your choice of an American continental breakfast, some decent bakeries, Asian fried rice and chicken or pork congee. Maybe the bacon is a bit rubbery on a quite a few occasions, perhaps they can fry a smidge longer to give it that crunch.   5/5 great value for your money! Check around and you will see for yourself.   5/5 for service and hospitality. The exemplary service starts at the top from the hotel manager  to the housekeeping staff who all radiate a genuine concern for the well-being and comfort of the guests. This without exception is why as much as I like to be pampered at the 5 star premium hotels , am now a fan of the Mercure Bangkok Siam! \u2026",

Don't set expectation for pool as it's very small and not even good for swimming at all.   7-11 is on ground floor, very convenient.  Coffee at the bar was okay, not great, but at least on standard.

Their maid is also polite and did a great job! I recommend this hotel for people who want to relax and find a hotel near BTS station. Thumbs up!  - Pitchawee",

Just like my past experiences staying at Mercure Bangkok Siam that filled with many fond memories, the services by Mercure Bangkok Siam staff was exceptional.   The guest relation team such as Mai, May, Jam and Fon are friendly and attentive. They seem to remember I have stayed in before and make every possible way to elevate my experience as a valued guest. Also kudos to the house-keeping team in maintaining the room fresh and comfortable. For those who need a quiet, restful night stay in Bangkok downtown center, this is the right hotel for you besides it's conveniently located next to BTS station and major tourist\u2026",

I think there were two different teams of people who cleaned my room.  One of the team is very thoughtful.  They knew I am a heavy water drinker and always gave me enough bottles of water so I won't have to call the front desk to ask more.  I have booked  my stay through Accord app and extended my stay about four times.  One of the time I had not idea why that when I clicked breakfast included, it ended up without breakfast.  Because I had used my membership points so I could not cancel and rebook it.  It would have been very helpful for the app to allow me making amendments regardless if using my membership points.  Anyway, the hotel Manager was kind\u2026",

First long silence with no response and then very confusing messages.  Finally, I received the correct package which includes 9hrs of stay as well as a set lunch (three courses).  The room size varies quite a bit, one room was very big with a wide-open bathroom and the other one was much smaller with a different layout. The floor is white marble so quite cold. In the 2nd, smaller, room, the desk size was not really sufficient to work comfortably.  What I disliked was the appearance of disorganization when it come to the 57 Restaurant. We were given a Titanium letter upon check-in only to be told that the staff needed to check eligibility. The lounge is still closed for renovations so part of 57 is dedicated for lounge use. After about 20 minutes of waiting staff came around to tell us that we were not entitled to get the afternoon tea. When I referred them to the benefit letter, I was a) told that this was a mistake but that they would honor the offer and b) ... and this is where it gets crazy, that they had actually discontinued the afternoon tea. So, all of the hassle for one latte and one cup of tea ... not happy!\u2026",

There were problems during my first stay with the window cleaning on Sunday morning, but they were sorted out nicely. Housekeeping was very into the details. I love how they turned down the room at night. They tied my charging cables and put sweets in the bedroom.   Breakfast was really great. It's an ala carte buffet. I love the coffee drip V60, scrumble eggs, and waffles. Sadly, there were not many selections on the menu.  Don't miss a Peking duck at Nan-Bei. It's different from others but it's great. I also tried Pot Sticker and Teas. They're all wonderful. However, don't order the set menu; as my first time there, I got a dinner set menu come together with a room rate and it didn't taste good.

Window in our suit was dirty .The breakfast - thai restaurant is very incomprehensible. Wrong colour sofas, no scenery, No decor, not enough greens and you dosnt feel WOW . The pool is located in a catastrophically ungood place. In the shade ,under the tones of iron and metal. It's impossible to sunbathe. The water is cold. SPA. Reception table in the same room as guest waiting for therapy,its 1 metre between table with computer and lot of paper, so you feel working mood more than relax . It's not a spa, it's just massage rooms. Because no rest area, no sauna. No feet bath. Therapists' level is 3/5. Nothing is prepared for relaxation in the room except music ..There are candles, but no one use them..so you save it for who?  I just feel in 2021 hotels should use really good material and landscape design to be on the TOP, otherwise its will go down and down ..\u2026",

One thing to highlight, Rosewood provides the most expensive Dyson hair dryer, which is very fancy and fast to get dried, wish I could have one in my condo lol.

Accommodation: It was a wonderful time to stay in an executive suite with a separate living room, bedroom and bathroom.  The rooms are decorated in brown tones.  The living room has a beautiful set of leather sofas and a work desk. The bedroom is spacious and sleeps well.  There is a bathtub with a glass partition between bathroom and bedroom.  (I like this corner)   Food: delicious breakfast but I ordered dining in-room is shrimp fried rice and tom yum goong.  The soup tastes not like Tom Yum goong.  Lounge: although no alcoholic beverages are served during this time.  But there are many other drink options and a small set of appetizers.  That can be ordered at any time. and I would like to\u2026",

The room was ok, twin beds, an amazing powerful shower, toiletries, a hairdryer, and air conditioning.

They upgraded our room to a bigger room for free. The room was massive with assortments of tea and coffee. The rooftop dinner at the Sirocco was amazing and very delicious. The staff were very helpful with taking photos of us and had personalised lights to help take better pictures. This was an amazing staycation and would definitely come back here one day! I would definitely recommend a stay at the Lebua and dinner at the Sirocco is a must-do as a  lifetime bucket list",

The food are replenished often even towards the end of breakfast time, 10am. The breakfast area, located at the lobby area is spacious and nice.    There are many massages shops along the way to MRT (Hua Khwang station) and the prices are generally cheaper than town area.  The walk to the MRT is around 15 minutes - good way to keep fit.

Nonetheless, the rooms were spacious, hot water and wifi worked fine. I enjoyed the view from my room. The bed was one of the most comfortable that I\u2019ve stayed in in Bangkok. Housekeeping was daily, elevator worked fine. There was also a nice breakfast buffet. There is a 7-11 right next to the hotel which is convenient.  The one downfall is the location \u2014 it is not a 15 minute walk to the MRT. I typically walk and take the BTS or MRT, yet I used Grab to get to the MRT because it was just easier than walking.   Overall, I did enjoy my stay here, however, just be aware that the location is probably not ideal if you don\u2019t like walking to get to the public transportation.

This is said to be an area that is still affordable to invest or stay just outside of the busy areas of Bangkok but like I said still accessible and a little closer to Don Mueang Airport.The Ganesha shrine is very close to Huay Kwang station and the Rot fai night market is not far either. The hotel was a little older but very charming and served an Asian style breakfast that was quite adequate. Every time I entered the lobby Morning or night  there was a player piano playing which made for a very nice atmosphere . I also found some amazing thai massage shops for  250 baht an hour as well as some great local dining experiences .

The furniture and fittings also are quite old and I really hope you aren\u2019t tall because you\u2019ll be kneeling in the bathtub to have a shower.

It is along a safe and lively Rangnam Street with at least a couple of 7/11s, numerous coffee shops, street food, restaurants, a shopping mall which had a night street food market, other nice hotels, and a green park where you can jog or just sit around.  There are also tuktuks and taxis waiting along the street (which I avoided at all cost as there is a BTS).  4.  Breakfast buffet was good and dishes changed daily.

Being an official delegate for the said occasion, I got free accommodation for entire duration of the event. The main event was held at the hotel and all the delegates from other Asian countries were booked here. The hotel is one of the oldest hotels located at the outskirt of Bangkok but it is accessible to the old airport, Don Muang and could be considered as one of the best ones two decades ago!  he organizer chose the hotel since it is more convenient to reach my Alma mater in Pathumthani, away from the heavy traffic of the metropolis.   The hotel's entrance gate is along the main highway but the main lobby of the hotel is bit far, and still need for the vehicle or taxi to move about 200 meters to reach the building. The hotel has a spacious lobby and have sofas for guest and visitors to sit. It has a bar adjoining the lobby and the dining area where the breakfast is serve. As we all know, Thai food is excellent and there were a lot of good choices of food - main course to desserts, drinks to fruits. The hotel has several function rooms to cater a huge number of guests. Unfortunately, I missed its swimming pool!  I was fortunate to occupy the big room (with two single beds) by myself. The room is spacious compare to other hotels that I have stayed in Asia which is very ideal for family affair. However, despite the availability of basic amenities of the room, it was a surprise for me to found out that the \"wifi\" connection is \"not free\", or rather was not included in the accommodation which is very unusual for a hotel. In other words, internet service is an added expense on top of the accommodation.   Being a traveller or a tourist, communication is very essential and internet connection is the easiest and fastest way to keep connected and updated with friends, colleagues and families. I personally asked the front manager, and it was explained to me that the organizer did not include internet connection to our accommodation. What made me feel disappointed with the hotel management, was that the hourly rate for the wifi is very expensive as one time login only - which means that the time is clicking even you are not using the service.   If I will be given another chance to visit Bangkok, choosing Rama Gardens will be my last option!\u2026",

But on the second day, we are forced to eat at the regular breakfast area where the food is cold,baked beans are like boiled in water. Coffee has only one option and I had an espresso the day before but today needed to pay for it.

Initially I had the place to myself enjoying my dinner, the live music as well as the attention by the duo. The played Bee Gees and hit my chord. Lovely voices\u2026",

We tried their Japanese restaurant which was not too pricey and the food was good.  Recommend if you need to stay in Don Muang area. ",

I had worst experience and paid approx 1200 THB for the sake of mini bar which i did not even drink that much. They prepared the bill how they liked it . When i told to the receptionist that i did not drink and its in the refrigerator but they kept on insisting me to pay whatever they mentioned on bill.  Rooms were stinking and lights were even not working . Please be careful before you book this hotel , specially with receptionist who even dont care your concerned.",

Each and every team member of the hotel from front desk, to housekeeping, to reservation, to sports & recreation, tuk tuk transport, engineering & maintenance etc. has been warm, helpful and diligent throughout our stay which we appreciate their hospitality.  We would definitely return to stay at the hotel when we are back in Bangkok.  ",

We checked out with the manager Mr.Kayyasit who also gave me a warm farewel. I really recommend this place if you have a vacation or business travel in the Bangkok city centre.",

The hotel is not really that close to the BTS but if you are carrying a small bag then it is fine. If you are have a large suitcase you can simply call the Hotel and they will send the Tuktuk to pick you up somewhere close to the BTS. The staff in the front desk are excellent and very very helpful. One of the lady spent a lot of time helping me to find my parcels. The housekeeping staff are also excellent as they know what you need in your room. My entire stay there was excellent except the shower pressure was quite low and some of the stuff there may need to be fixed. I will be happy to stay there again for my next trip.",

There was even a couch in the room where we could lounge on.  Surprisingly, there was also a kitchenette, which we were not expecting since it was not an apartment suite. No complaints though, because we love how we could bring back loads of food and drink to the room.  The staff at the concierge were very helpful as well, especially when we were seeking directions. They used their computers to search for directions to places which they did not know as well.  The only drawback was that the hotel was about a 10-15 minutes walk from BTS Chidlom Station (Exit 4). and the path along the way was a little unsteady due to the\u2026",

First of all, I love the area where the hotel is located, Soi Lang Suan is a living street with many locals working in the Bank/Financial sector and you feel not stressed by too many tourists or bars that can be sometime annoying for travellers looking for something more quiet in the heart of Bangkok. The hotel is really well managed; the staff is very friendly and professional. I have nothing to say about the accommodation: the air conditioned room is provided with everything you need (I really appreciate the kitchen corner of the executive suite), the bathroom is very functional and the comfort of the\u2026",

The room was spacious enough although the TV screen could be a bit bigger and the decor needed update, customer services were top notch (very responsive and attentive). The pool was a bit cold due to not heated, not ideal if you want to do some laps, there was a library with good selection of books, the gym equipments were good although the treadmills need some services. Our room had microwave and stove top and big fridge and utensils if you would like to cook, there wasnt a washing machine but you can buy a token at front desk for 95 baht for laundry facilities which was located at the basement. Hotel location was ok, walking from the hotel to Centrel World was doable (15 min walk), hotel offers tuk tuk\u2026",
