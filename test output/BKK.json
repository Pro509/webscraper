The MO has a package called Experience the Legend which we took full advantage of (and will again very soon).   Rather than save the cash we paid what would normally (roughly) be the price for a basic room and instead got a Chao Phraya suite.   It was absolutely lovely.  To the point that I think I could live there.  There is nothing we can criticise about our stay.  We had the best time, the most lovely staff and came away very happy with the firm intention of returning and repeating before the offers end.  Fabulous.",

This establishment is all about the people, and you find that out when you get to know them. From the GM, who is on his second sting, to the Head of Guest Relations, who has been there for 31 years, all the way to our wonderful driver, who has been there for 29 years !! It says a lot about how an operation is run, when you see so much loyalty. It certainly gets reflected on how guests are treated.  As for the facilities, I'll simply say that their historical renovations are absolutely magnificent, well deserving for such an iconic hotel, not just in Bangkok, but the global Mandarin Oriental family.  Absolute no doubt that it will remain our #1\u2026",

The butler service was a nice touch as well.  Breakfast was wonderful. They offered a-la-carte menu only because of the pandemic, but the menu was quite substantial. Everything was tasty and good quality. The service was a bit slow, but I didn\u2019t really mind.  We dined at Ciao Terrazza on our first night. Advance reservation recommended if you want a table by the river. The food was, overall, tasty and of generous portion. The staff was super nice and\u2026",

We dined at the Varendah and the iconic Author\u2019s lounge, and the food, service, and ambience was flawless. Breakfast by the river was of top notch quality with cosy setting by the riverside. We enjoy boat rides to Icon Siam and swimming pool during day time, and the great night time view of the Chaopraya river. A truly memorable stay. ",

Breakfast was extremely attentive and friendly under the young German manager\u2019s care (the croissants and baguette are to die for), restaurant Belga on the rooftop served exquisite mussels and an excellent steak tartare - thank you Peter and team - and the Exec lounge staff was very friendly. The superb 30th floor lounge was closed (I assume due to Covid savings needs) however the care and friendliness on display almost made up for it! Housekeeping was spot on. Of course the location is hard to beat and the new skywalk to the BTS, or just\u2026",

Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the German guy from Breakfast and at Tea Time at the Lounge, he was very friendly and gave some good tips in order to safe money for some sightseeing trips. Breakfast is good, but on weekends it takes too long to get a coffee. The checkin was friendly, but I didn't get any advise about the room, not sure if I got an upgrade or not. I couldn't remember what i booked, but I believe I didn't get an upgrade this time. I got my welcome drink and my points were credited the next day.

The room was great with high quality bed sheet, clean and the location was perfect, just only 5 mins walk to Terminal 21 shopping mall and BTS.  The hotel prepared a surprise BD cake to make it more memorable and the overall service was really nice.  We have got a chance to also try Belgian foods at Belga, the rooftop bars which is only 2 floors away from our room and the food was great, especially the Mussels in the pot which they cook with Hoegardenn beer and White wine, definitely will need to be back there again for dinner soon.

From our experience, the hotel sadly falls far short of its 5 star rating on the one thing that Thais are so famous for having in abundance: their hospitality. My wife and I recently stayed at the hotel on their very appealing \u201cstaycation\u201d package that they are currently promoting to Thai nationals and residents, which is inclusive of all meals and use of standard amenities. However, we were left feeling disappointed and, on occasions, uncomfortable by the cold and impersonal front of house team, to the surly\u2026",

Hash browns were like tater tots that had been defrosted. Lunch time I tired a pizza that was served with a side of ketchup. I think after so many tries I just gave up on the food. If you stay here I recommend not eating here. Pool and gym were nice. A couple of the machines were out of order in the gym. They have a huge selection of cardio machines and free weights. My first day staying there I was gone almost the entire day and left the service light on in my room. Was surprised to return to my room after 8pm and find that\u2026",

After the first night my Wife reported to staff of unusual noises coming from the Aircon that were a bit noisy , they replied they will send someone to look at it , while we were out . On return we recieved a letter saying , Aircon maintanance will take place the following day 12-2pm !!! Conviently after we already checked out , so good luck\u2026",

Staffs at lobby were friendly I feel very welcome since I enter the hotel.  Khun Nuam bellboy who help me with luggage and escorted me to my room is helpful. He invited me to hotel's skybar which I can say that this bar become one of my list already. I went to skybar during happy hour as Khun Nuam suggest, the drinks were great, the view also stunning. Room was ok, view from room was incredible. I haven't try Chinese restaurant but I will come back again to try it.",

Nice bathroom too, and everything just works perfectly.  The best part of the stay were the staff though, some of the friendliest and most attentive I ever met. Especially the Korean lady at reception, Ester. She remembered my name from day one and even when I came back after a few months with no booking, just a walk in, she remembered my name. Impressive, she should get a raise :)  Anyway, everything else was great too, facilities and the pool are fantastic.   This is definitely\u2026",

It was a good promotion for the price. We had a two bedroom corner suite on the same floor as the pool which was very convenient. Being relatively new, the hotel is clean and modern with a stylish pool/ bar area. Breakfast was good, if a little limited, but the lunch we had was a little disappointing. Another downside was they only issued one room key and this stopped working a couple of hours before check out. It was quickly resolved, but not ideal when you\u2019re trying to get your kids showered and changed after swimming,  Staff were friendly and helpful. We\u2019d definitely stay again if they ran a similar promotion, as the hotel is in a great location.\u2026",

From breakfast to the pool area, the gym, the restaurants just everywhere. But most impressive was the kind welcome decoration and the sweet treats when we came back to our room on Saturday. That was very thoughtful and the happiness and smile of my wife was priceless. Bedding is very comfortable. Breakfast selection offers a great variety and service is very efficient. The dining experience at the Kintsugi was OK (see separate review) so tonight we will opt for the 'The house of smooth curry'.

We were upgraded to a beautiful Panoramic Executive Suite (#2802). The suites are showing their age although this room clearly was upgraded since our last stay about 3 1/2 years ago. We love the view from the room, partly over the beautiful Chao Praya River and the surrounding area.  The Executive Lounge was unfortunately closed due to renovation works so the experience was shifted to a cafe next to the reception area. A bit busy for my taste but the spread was acceptable given the current situation. Breakfast was good although the line on Sunday morning looked like a bad day at immigration.  What we did not appreciate was that dinner service consists of a buffet at the Flow and if you do not like that, the only option we had (on Saturday night) was to go for a dark snack on the rooftop. On days where that outlet is closed (which is pretty much the whole week), you may have to go for some food outside the hotel.  Sadly, the river boats are also not operating at this time. What a shame. Many other riverside properties have this service now so not sure why our Hilton cannot.  All in all, we still very much enjoyed our stay. The Millennium is special to us so we shall no doubt be back for more.\u2026",

What I was a bit dissatisfied was some of the guests didn\u2019t wear the plastic disposable gloves when they picked up some food at the executive lounge.

The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We booked a Premier One Bedroom which was extremely good value. The room has a kitchen with fridge, stove, micro wave, with plates abd utensils. If you need anything else for the kitchen just call Housekeeping. There was a sofa and coffee table and a good sized flat screen TV, as well as a desk and lamp.The bedroom has a comfortable bed, safe, and wardrobes. The bathroom is a good size with toiletries provided. Basically it is a serviced apartment. We didnt have a view, just the building nextdoor, but higher up you would, or at the front or rear of the building (we were on the side). We didn't have breakfast, but there was a promotion going which made it more than reasonable. There is a very good gym, and an \"L shaped\" pool that wraps around the rear of the building. The pool is deep compared to many Thai pools, and refreshingly cool. We had an issue getting the channels on the bedroom TV. We rang reception and someone came up and fixed it in 5 minutes. All requests to reception were handled promptly. Parking is available. Like a lot of Thai carparks the headroom appears low, however we have a huge 4wd car and managed to park without any problems. The rooms are spotlessly clean. If I were looking for something to criticise I would say that some of the furnishing is getting a bit worn, but not to the extent that it looked bad or I wouldn't want to stay there. I would say given the very reasonable price for the room (and there were several room types cheaper or dearer for that matter), the size of the room, 2 TV's, cleanliness, the kitchen, pool, and parking--that Siri Sathorn is a hotel I would happily stay in again.\u2026",

Pulled up to the front and was told by security that could not drive up to front unloading area as an artist was about to leave for concert nearby and that I should wait patiently in the front of the hotel...10 minutes go by and no word. I start to see my parking is causing congestion, so I decide to go park in the parking garage instead, as no big deal, understand a concert is occurring. Fast forward to when I am checking out and my son is having his after non nap. He obviously likes to sleep a lot :) So call down to the front desk and ask them if we can postpone 1 hour on checkout and tell them the little one is sleeping. Put on hold and told, apologies there are\u2026",

Service quite good. My friend left the key in the room, after tell the receptionist, no longer the staff help to open the room. But one thing, i ask for scissor but they\u2026",

While the lobby and bar area is gorgeous, the bathrooms are dated and in need of renovating although they are clean.

As said, they finished the renovation early August if not mistaken, in time for the peak season in October. Repainted, redecorated. Flat screen with set top box with hundreds of channel that one need to have some instructions to use. Not the typical hotel in-house TV anymore.  WiFi are strong with a few router in one floor, connect to your nearest and provided with individual username and password for 1 day. Speed test low ping and speed at about 20 mbps. Superb.

The bathroom could use a little TLC with mild spots and unclean looking bath but the water was always hot. English channels can be found on the tv which I found great. The location is also great as you only need to walk outside and you have a whole stretch of street food, 7/11 and also asiatech the pier which holds a night market.

Need to go out door 6 and although a little difficult to find signs for shuttle, when we saw the van, we were greeted with a friendly face and arrived at the hotel in no time.  Room is clean and sufficient for my 2 nights stay during short transit. Pool was lovely and quiet, though small.  We booked a room on 1st floor with pool access. It was great with a little balcony with a couple of chairs where you can watch the kids play in the pool. My family stayed right next door though rooms were not adjoining, but easy access between balconies.  There is a new Robinson's mall short walk (maybe 2-3 mins walk) where there is a food court and supermarket, restaurants.   Would return &\u2026",

Massages nearby. Pool water - very cold, my guesstimate 21-22 - can cool you down or wake you up, not the best for a long play with kids. staff very helpful and OK. all in all - medium",

Very reasonable, pool & restaurant onsite, would stay here again. Used a Suite with adjoining rooms for 3 persons on arrival & a Queen room for 2 on departure. Not close to City Centre, need to take taxi to rail into city sites if visiting for longer. For connecting to other areas in Thailand by air and needing to overnight - this is the place. Booked directly online with The Cottage and got discounts (not expedia or tripadvisor). Changed dates without issue, correspondence takes 24 hrs due to time change.",

There is a little garden to sit in and relax plus the swimming pool. It's extremely quiet, situated down a side road, so traffic won't bother you.  We had an early 6.00am departure for the airport so the hotel provided us with a picnic breakfast, which we ate in the airport - again perfectly adequate for the start of our journey. In addition, there was hot water available in the lobby - very useful! Thank you Cottage Hotel. P/S I really liked the tall Palm Tree leaves outside our balcony...greenery and nature in the metropolis!",

I can\u2019t really say anything as at all, because the staff was so amazing and respectful and the shuttle from the airport made getting to the resort so much easier!

Great location with free shuttle service although you do have to wait if arriving/departing in between the scheduled times. Only general issue at present is the noise form the building work being carried out next to the hotel - even too noisy to stay out near the pool in the day time and it did go on after the supposed published finish time of 8.00PM. Also on our second stay the air conditioning in the room was not efficient as in the room on our first stay. Breakfast good. Staff very polite and helpful. We did eat dinner one night in the restaurant and that was fine too but also I would recommend a great food court in the mall near by. Otherwise no complaints and i would\u2026",

It is close to the airport and priced decent, the room is plain, needs a good cleaning and maybe a picture on the wall, one night would be different but two was too much. Staff were present but not overly helpful.  I wouldn\u2019t walk any where after dark and the sky train isn\u2019t conveniently located and good luck getting a taxi back from the sky train to the hotel!  Breakfast compared to all the other hotels was not desirable. No I would not stay here again.    ",
